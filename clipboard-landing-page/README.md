## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learned that there is no need for the use of "margin= 0 auto" while using grid.

### Continued development

In this project, I didn't really find difficulties in building the website, but my head was all over the place once I started it, and this project was a good one to refine my grid skills.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_object-position.asp] - This helped me with positioning the image of the desktop to the left.
- [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43962217/centering-columns-in-css-grid] - This helped me figuring out that I really don't need the margin property when using grid.
