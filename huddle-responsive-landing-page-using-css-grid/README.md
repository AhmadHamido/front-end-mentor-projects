## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Learned to use less code
2. Learned to use less block elements that contain the content(like "div")
3. Learned to use the auto-fill and auto-fit with minmax
4. Got better with sizing rows and columns

### Continued development

I still need to work on my ability of putting sizes on the images when they are inside a grid
